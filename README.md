# TempMail-Voter-Automation
A Node.js script that automates the process of creating temporary email addresses using the TempMail.lol API, casting votes on the WaysConf platform, and confirming the votes through email verification. The script runs in a loop, allowing multiple votes to be cast using different email addresses.
